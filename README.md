# Virtualization Lab

## Overview
This project builds and tests multiple virtual machines on a Windows host using VirtualBox. It shows how to set up, connect, and verify isolated operating systems in a repeatable way.

## What This Demonstrates
- Understanding of virtualization concepts
- VM resource planning and isolation
- Snapshot and recovery strategy
- Basic virtual networking
- System validation and testing
- Clear technical documentation

## Project Structure
/docs – design and test notes  
/configs – VM resource profiles  
/scripts – setup helpers  
/evidence – verification output  

## How to Reproduce
1. Install VirtualBox and the Extension Pack.
2. Create the VMs using the documented configs.
3. Install guest tools and take baseline snapshots.
4. Run the validation checks.
